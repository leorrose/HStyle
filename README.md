# Hstyle

A historical style generator (historical style document synthesis).

HStyle lets users synthesize a historical document. What does this mean? Given two documents, one is a historical document (the style), and the other is a modern document (the content), HStyle will transfer the style from the historical document to the modern document. This system is based on a deep learning model and computer vision techniques and will be a web based application.

This Project was created with <b> Python, FastAPI, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Angular, Bootstrap and more liberais</b>.
